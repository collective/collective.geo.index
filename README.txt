Introduction
============

This Product adds a geospatial index to the zope catalog for collective.geo.

OOTB it only adds the index and a searchform, query_spatialcatalog.html,
which lets you explore the usage of the index. It is meant to be used in
custom products that need a spatial search.

It depends on the spatialindex and tools libraries from SpatialIndex.
You can find installation instructions for spatialindex on
http://trac.gispython.org/lab/wiki/Rtree.
